After setting up `Github Pages` to host [NeLk.IO][nelk-io] (it's only taken me 3-4 years to replubish the page!) I've decided to have a look at the features that Jekyll offers as a blogging framework, so I guess all that's left to say is...

{% highlight java %}

public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}
