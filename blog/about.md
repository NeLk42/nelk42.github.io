# Hey there! I'm Ramon...

...an Adobe Consultant based in London, UK, nice to meet you! :). 

I believe in following Agile practices, TDD and CI, I'm passionate about learning and improving, and although I love programming I admit I have a particular soft spot for [android][android] development, as I lately find myself more and more finding the time to have fun playing with [Kotlin][kotlin]. 

I **love** [reading][audible], wrap it all with a passion for [learning][udacity], [drawing][joemad] and a [gamer's heart][blizzard], add a fresh pinch of [charting crypto][trading-view] and you got me all figured out.
